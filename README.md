# 📘 Java Learning
Welcome to my Java Learning repository!
This repo documents my journey as I re-learn Java from scratch — covering the basics to advance concepts, writing small programs, and gradually building more projects.

🧭 Goals

✅ Refresh and strengthen my Java fundamentals

✅ Practice writing clean, readable, and efficient Java code

✅ Track learning progress publicly using GitHub

✅ Build a strong foundation for real-world Java development (OOP, files, exceptions, etc.)

✅ Use Git and GitHub consistently
